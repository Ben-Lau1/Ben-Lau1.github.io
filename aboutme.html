    <div class="profile-main-content">
        <p>I graduated from Northwest Agriculture and Forestry University in July 2024 with a Bachelor's
             degree in Computer Science and Technology (GPA: 3.79/4.0, Rank: 2/131), and my undergraduate thesis was 
             recognized as an Excellent Undergraduate Thesis. During my undergraduate studies, I developed
              a profound interest in computer vision, particularly in 3D point cloud processing and 
              analysis.</p>
        <p>My academic journey began with implementing and comparing classical point cloud deep learning 
            frameworks (such as PointNet++ and PAConv) on agricultural fruit point cloud datasets. 
            This initial experience provided me with a foundational understanding of the research directions and technical challenges in point cloud deep learning.</p>
        <p>Subsequently, as a team leader (of 5 members), I delved deeper into "Research on Segmentation 
            and Recognition of Three-Dimensional Fruit Traits Based on Point Cloud Deep Learning" (06/2022 – 06/2024). In this project, we not only constructed a strawberry point cloud dataset under complex scenarios but also innovatively designed a density-based feature extraction and feature spreading network, <strong>FSDNet</strong>, tailored for agricultural picking scenarios, which significantly improved segmentation accuracy. This work has been published in <em>Computers and Electronics in Agriculture</em> (SCI Q1 IF: 8.3). Furthermore, as a core member, I contributed to the "Design and Research of Point Cloud Neural Network Based on High-Order Feature Interaction" project, where we adapted the HorNet architecture from the image domain to point clouds, developing <strong>Point HorNet</strong>. This network achieved excellent performance on the Stanford indoor point cloud dataset, and the findings were accepted by the ICVR 2024 conference. My graduation thesis focused on optimizing point cloud grouping and sampling algorithms, where I designed a grid-based sampling and grouping scheme and a lightweight network, <strong>GPFEnet</strong>, substantially enhancing algorithmic efficiency. This research has been accepted by the IJCNN 2025 conference.</p>
        <p>These research experiences have provided me with a comprehensive and in-depth understanding 
            of the entire point cloud deep learning pipeline, from dataset construction, algorithm design 
            and improvement, code implementation and debugging, to manuscript writing and publication. 
            I am proficient in Python, C/C++, and CUDA C programming, adept with deep learning frameworks 
            like PyTorch, and skilled in conducting research and development efficiently within a Linux 
            environment.</p>

            I am committed to applying research outcomes to solve complex real-world 
            problems and look forward to making meaningful contributions to 3D computer vision/deep learning/machine learning.</p>
